# Image-Colorization_Group8
The goal of this project is to use convolutional neural networks to colorize grayscale images. 

The database used to train the model was MIT places 2: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nickj26/places2-mit-dataset 
The code was adapted from: https://lukemelas.github.io/image-colorization.html 
The main code for building the model is the file: Image_Colorization_Group8_Code.py

We wanted to compare how colorization would be affected if we trained 12 images vs 500 images. The processing time for 12 images was about 10 minutes whereas the processing time for 500 images was about 2 hours. We also looked two different regression models and compared their loss. That being the mean squared error and the Hubor loss.
